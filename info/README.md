# War Game

## Warning: Flash

This game was exported in Flash and, as you probably know, Flash has been discontinued. As such, I can only provide access to the source code and the `.swf` file at the moment.

If you happen to have an ancient computer that still runs Flash in the browser, or a copy of the Adobe Flash Standalone Player, you should be able to run the game.

At some point I may port the game to JavaScript or similar, and it's possible that the [ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) Flash emulator will get to a point where this game will run again. Let's see.

## Description
War Game was written in ActionScript 3 using Adobe&#8217;s FlashBuilder 4.6 and the excellent [Flixel](http://www.flixel.org/) library. Sound effects were made in [bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/). The screen font is [Digital 7](http://www.dafont.com/digital-7.font) by [Chess 7](http://www.dafont.com/chess-7-chess-7.d1833) and the label font is [Misery Loves Company](http://www.dafont.com/misery-loves-company.font) by [KC Fonts](http://www.kcfonts.com/). Much inspiration drawn from [Pica Pic](http://www.pica-pic.com/), especially [Sub Attack](http://www.pica-pic.com/#/sub_attack/).
